# amino-acid-sequence-alignment
This program uses C++ to determine the similarity of two amino acid sequences, and output the final aligned sequence.
The main aim of this program is to to find out the best sequence alignment by calculating the highest possible score.

It introduce gaps into the sequences to make the lengths equal. Any extra gaps inserted will lead to increment of penalty.
This program requires users to enter the sequences and mis match penalty and gap penalty.

Algorithms and concepts used:
- Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
- Dynamic programming
- Divide-and-conquer strategy
